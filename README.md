# Retail_Sales_Analysis
This project develops a probability model to predict sales and evaluate uncertainty based on retail data.

Retail Sales Prediction with Probability Models
This project aims to develop a probability model to predict sales outcomes and evaluate uncertainty using data from a global retail store. The analysis utilizes historical sales data over 4 years, covering product categories like Furniture, Office Supplies, and Electronics. Key insights include identifying best-selling products, peak sales periods, and customer segmentation.

Objectives
Sales Prediction: Use probability distributions and simulations to predict future sales.
Uncertainty Evaluation: Evaluate uncertainty through variance and confidence intervals.
Data Insights: Identify best-selling products, peak sales periods, and customer segmentation based on geographical and product category data.
Steps Involved

1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
Data Understanding: Explore the dataset, clean the data, and ensure consistency.
Data Transformation: Convert data types (e.g., dates to datetime, Postal Code to String).

2. Probability Models & Simulations
Simulation using Random Variables: Generate probability distributions and simulate possible sales outcomes for each region.
Prediction: Use the mean of the simulated outcomes to predict expected sales, then calculate variance and confidence intervals to assess uncertainty.

3. Analysis and Insights
Best-Selling Products: Group products by name, count total sales, and rank by highest sales volume.
Peak Sales Periods: Group sales data by time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) and identify the periods with the highest sales.
Customer & Geographical Segmentation: Analyze sales based on customer segments and geographic regions.

4. Descriptive Statistics
Sales Distribution: Analyze the distribution of sales, identifying skewness and outliers.
Statistical Insights: Compare historical averages and variances with simulated outcomes.
