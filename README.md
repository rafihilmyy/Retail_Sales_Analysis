# Retail Sales Prediction with Probability Models

This project develops a probability model to predict future sales outcomes and assess uncertainty using historical data from a global retail store. The dataset spans 4 years and includes product categories such as Furniture, Office Supplies, and Electronics. The analysis aims to uncover insights like best-selling products, peak sales periods, and customer segmentation.

### Objectives
* Sales Prediction

Utilize probability distributions and simulations to forecast future sales.

* Uncertainty Evaluation

Assess uncertainty through variance and confidence intervals.

* Data Insights

Identify best-selling products, peak sales periods, and customer segments based on geographic and product data.

### Steps Involved
**1. Data Cleaning & Preparation**
* Data Understanding -> Explore, clean, and ensure data consistency.
* Data Transformation -> Convert data types (e.g., dates to datetime, Postal Codes to strings).
  
**2. Probability Models & Simulations**
* Simulating Sales Outcomes -> Generate probability distributions to simulate future sales scenarios for different regions.
* Prediction -> Calculate the mean of simulated outcomes as predicted sales, and evaluate uncertainty using variance and confidence intervals.

**3. Analysis & Insights**
* Best-Selling Products -> Group products by name and rank them by total sales volume.
* Peak Sales Periods -> Group sales data by time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) to identify peak sales intervals.
* Customer & Geographic Segmentation -> Segment sales by customer type and geographic location for deeper insights.

**4. Descriptive Statistics**
* Sales Distribution -> Analyze the sales distribution to identify skewness, outliers, and anomalies.
* Statistical Comparison -> Compare historical averages and variances with simulated predictions for validation.
